# OSAutomation
This is a project for my course of Advance Operating Systems sem 5. I aim to record and replay a recorded procedure to automate repetitive task using GUI automation in python.

The code to record tasks is named MouseKeyLogger. It works only on linux and the module that I've used (pynput) doesn't worl for windows.
The task playing file lies in the KeyLogRunner.py
Make sure both files lie in the same directory.
